Dpic is an implementation of the pic "little language" for creating line
drawings and illustrations for documents, web pages, and other uses.

Unix installation:
   Type `./configure' to generate a Makefile, then `make' to compile the
   sources.  Type `make install' or, if necessary, `sudo make install' to
   install the executable in /usr/bin, a man page in /usr/share/man/man1,
   and dpicdoc.pdf in /usr/share/dpic.  To install the executable only,
   type `make installdpic' and to install the documents only, type
   `make installdocs'.

   If the installation fails, look at the file Makefile.default, and use
   it instead.

Web-server installation:
   You probably should disable the sh and copy commands in dpic for security
   reasons.  Uncomment the SAFEMODE definition in Makefile or invoke
   ./configure above as ./configure --enable-safemode.
   If you do not do this, the -z command-line option has the same effect
   (see below).

Installation on a non-unix PC:
   If you do not wish to compile the program, copy dpic.exe from the
   distribution Windows directory into your folder of executable files.
   You can also compile as above using make and your favourite compiler.

   Otherwise, commands equivalent to the following should do the trick:
      gcc   -O  -c  dpic.c
      gcc   -O  -c  p2clib.c
      gcc -o dpic dpic.o p2clib.o -lm


Dpic usage:

   dpic [option] infile > outfile
or 
   cat infile | dpic [option] > outfile 

Options:
   (none)    LaTeX picture output (limited font-based drawing capability)
   -d        basic PDF output, no automatic string formatting
   -e        pict2e output
   -f        Postscript output, strings in psfrag format 
   -g        TikZ-pgf output
   -h        write this message and quit
   -m        mfpic output (see mfpic documentation)
   -p        PSTricks output (see PSTricks documentation)
   -r        raw Postscript output, no automatic string formatting
   -s        MetaPost output (for compatibility)
   -t        eepicemu output (slightly less limited than LaTeX output)
   -v        svg output
   -x        xfig 3.2 output (for wysiwyg drawing)
   -z        safe mode (sh and copy disabled)

Testing:
   Test the installation by typing

     dpic -p quick.pic > quick.tex
     or
     dpic -g quick.pic > quick.tex
     (if you want to test the TikZ-pgf output)

   which produces the input for the following test LaTeX file:

      \documentclass{article}
      \usepackage{pstricks} % or \usepackage{tikz}
      \begin{document}

      \begin{figure}[hbt]
         \begin{center}
         \input quick
         \caption{Customized caption for the figure}
         \end{center}
         \label{Symbolic label}
      \end{figure}
      \end{document}

You can also do the tests in the examples directory (see below for
the distribution directory structure).

           |-doc------
           |
           |-examples-|-sources-
           |          
 dpic-DATE-|          |-Pgen----|-src--
           |          |
           |-src------|-p2c-----|-src--
                      |
                      |-pascal--|-test-
                      |-tables--

Typing "make" in the pascal directory converts the proto-pascal in
the src directory to pascal that is compatible either with GNU pascal
(gpc) or with Free Pascal (fpc) and compiles the source, placing the
executable and the required tables in the pascal/test directory.

Bugs:
   If you discover a bug, please check that your version is the
   latest.  Feel free to send bug reports.  Dpic has been relatively
   solid but, by definition, it hasn't been tested for all possible
   illegal input, and the distribution has undergone some recent changes
   to simplify the source and make the pascal available.

   When inconsistencies between dpic and gpic are found, I usually check
   to see whether dpic should be changed to conform.  Error and warning
   messages are not identical.  Other exceptions can be found in the
   file dpicdoc.pdf.

Version:
   The version of dpic is the date the source was created, printed as a
   comment in dpic output.

Source:
   The source code was originally written and maintained in Pascal to
   run on IBM VM/CMS and DEC VMS operating systems, but it has been
   moved several times since and has evolved considerably.  The Pascal
   is translated to ANSI C by P2C, then changed to simplify reading
   and compilation and to run on a variety of platforms.  Proto-Pascal
   source files are included here in the src directory.  Selected lines
   must be uncommented for translation to C or for Pascal compilation.
   GNU pascal and Free Pascal are supported currently.  A parser generator
   such as the ubiquitous yacc was not readily available when dpic was
   first written so a different tool was employed.  If source files in
   the src directory are changed, the Makefile compiles, as necessary,
   the pascal to C translator and the parser generator with its output
   filters and runs them to produce new files in the formats requred.
   These tools are included here for the sole purpose of generating
   dpic C source.
